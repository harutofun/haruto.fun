## About this project
This is my main website.  
My first idea with this website was to hide a game that would be made using its native language (HTML/CSS/JS), but this is still under test at the moment. If I find it too difficult to proceed, I'll add an iframe with the game I planned for this site, which will then be made using Godot Engine. Whatever my approach toward this matter, this website will contain a free game since it's something I always wanted to provide my followers as a gift for their support.
